# Assessing dinosaur diversity before extinction
- Joukje kloosterman

English was used in this presentation, this is why this will be written in english aswell.
### The presentation
The presentation was quite easy to understand because she took a lot of time to introduce the subject. She talked about how 
she used the data to predict whether the dinosaurs population peaked, or already declined before the extinction. She used different approached to 
research this.

I am not really interested in this topic, which is why i would not do this project myself.

#### Question 1: The graph that showed her approach to see the diversity of dinosaurs before the event had a huge sudden decrease.What did she think was the reason for this?
The reason for this was that she replicated the graph by making it in another application. The real graph did not look like this and went down a little more smoothly. This is why
it looked like a "mini second extinction".

#### Question 2: She was looking for the diversity in dinosaurs before the extinction, the graph showed that the diversity went down before the event. But i was wondering if she also measured the total population. I thought it would possible for one certain dinosaur species to be dominant over other species. Which would explain why the diversity went down.
She also measured that, but it was hard to do that because the data is not complete. This made it awfully hard to actually know this.
