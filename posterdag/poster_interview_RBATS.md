- Wouter Zeevat
- Interviewing Ijsbrand Pool
- dit interview heb ik in het engels gedaan omdat iedereen hier engels sprak :)

### Why did you choose your project?
He chose this project because he was interested in evolution and wanted to further research that. 
He didn't really know much about BaTS and 

### Why did you choose the UMCG?
The UMCG was a good option because it's so big and there is much to do. He also thought it was a nice opportunity
because a lot of students end up working for the UMCG.

### What did you think was most fun?
The most fun about the project turned out to be working to the results. I found this anwser quite basic, like
there was no specific thing he loved to do. But i guess the project was fun overall.

### Was there a lot of communication or did you work alone mostly?
I asked this because i heard a lot of stories about students not being able to communicate well due to COVID.
He said the communication was fine, which did not sound perfect..

### Did you enjoy using R?
He said he didn't really like to use R before, but started to like it more and more throughout the project. I was really curious
about this because a lot of people do not like R.

### Would you do this again if it was possible?
He would do this again but not the specific project (because he already did it..)

Personally i think this project would not be cut out for me. I like the project itself but the results are really plain and
for an internship i would rather do something with a more visually appealing end result!
